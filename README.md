# Cryptid

A repository for the Cryptid script in Tabletop Simulator.

Requires Atom Editor and the Tabletop Simulator package. See http://berserk-games.com/knowledgebase/atom-editor-plugin/ for full details.

In the Settings for Packages->tabletopsimulator-lua, make sure the 'Insert other files specified in source code' box is checked.

Set the 'Base path for files you wish to #include' to the local parent folder of this repository.

For example, if you have this repository saved in 'D:\Documents\My Games\Tabletop Simulator\Scripts\Cryptid', set the base path to 'D:\Documents\My Games\Tabletop Simulator\Scripts'

If you want to edit the scripts directly from the temp folder, uncheck the 'Insert other files specified in source code' box and reload the scripts in Atom.
